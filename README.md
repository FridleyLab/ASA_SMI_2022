## Overview

The use of multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to explore the tumor
immune microenvironment (TIME) is gaining interest from many
investigators. Cell abundance is often associated with clinical
outcomes, but the use of cell spatial contexture along with abundance
can be more informative. To analyze the spatial information of mIF
studies we developed an R package, `spatialTIME`, and a Shiny
application, `iTIME`, that supplement each other. We will show how users
can implement a `spatialTIME` workflow of real-world mIF data and
associate it with clinical factors.

## Instructors

This minicourse is taught by members of Moffitt staff including Jordan
Creed, a data scientist in the Department of Health Informatics and Alex
Soupir, an applied research scientist in the Department of Biostatistics
and Bioinformatics
